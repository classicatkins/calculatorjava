# Java Swing Calculator

## Introduction
This repository contains two versions of a Java Swing-based calculator (`hwFour.java` and `hw4.java`). These applications are not just basic calculators but also serve as an excellent demonstration of Java Swing GUI capabilities, event handling in Java, and implementing fundamental arithmetic logic. They are ideal for beginners looking to understand GUI development in Java and for those interested in the practical application of Java programming concepts.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface:** Utilizes Java Swing to create a user-friendly interface with buttons and a display field.
- **Event Handling:** Implements `ActionListener` to handle button click events, showcasing how Java responds to user interactions.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, demonstrating the use of Java's arithmetic capabilities.
- **Input Validation:** Handles different types of inputs and calculates results without crashing, demonstrating basic error handling in a Java application.
- **Dynamic User Interaction:** Updates the display in real-time as the user inputs numbers and operations, providing an interactive experience.
- **Code Structure:** The code is structured in a way that separates the UI elements from the logic, making it easier to read and maintain.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) - version 8 or above
- A Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) or a simple text editor
